## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned


in this section a couple of new css background images properties for x and y axis to move image

```css
.proud-of-this-css{
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position-x: ;
  background-position-y: ;
}
```
