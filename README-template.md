## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

  It took me about an hour to make the project, i struggled when i had to check the responsiveness.

  i then figured out that i can use "min-width" to provide a suitable width for device width of 375px

  structering the project was not difficult the last two projects made me have a stronger appraoch to flexbox

### Built with

- CSS 
- HTML
- CSS Flexbox
- Margins and Padding
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

### What I learned

I should provide body padding so that the whole content can show on device width.

I should not set strict width for parent element as it restricts responsiveness
